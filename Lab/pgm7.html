        <h3>About College</h3>
	<marquee> <h5>Ensuring academic excellence by imparting quality education and moulding personalities based on the love of God <h5> </marquee>
	<p>St. George's College Aruvithura is a college under Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam. It is located in Aruvithura, Erattupetta, Kottayam District in Kerala, India. It was reaccredited with 'A++' Grade by NAAC for seven years in the fourth cycle.</p>
	<p>St. Georgeâ€™s College Aruvithura, is a minority educational institution founded by St. George Forane Church, Aruvithura in 1965. Pioneered under the patronage of His Excellency Mar Sebastian Vayalil, the first Bishop of Pala, and cherished by a host of visionaries and philanthropists like Very Rev. Fr. Thomas Araythinal and Mr T. A. Thomman (Former Minister), the college, right from its inception, embarked on an odyssey towards academic pre-eminence. Very Rev. Fr. Thomas Manakkat, the founding manager and a great visionary, was truly instrumental in laying the foundations for a great beginning and Very Rev. Fr. Jacob Thazhathel, who followed him, was equally adept and insightful in his ideals, guiding the college during the early stages of its growth. For more than two decades, His Excellency Mar Joseph Pallickaparampil, the Bishop of Pala, had been the patron of the college. His Excellency Mar Joseph Kallarangattu is the present patron of this seat of learning.</p>
<p>Now the College offers instruction in Arts, Science, and Commerce. As of now, we have 15 undergraduate courses namely, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Botany, Economics, Political Science, Commerce, English and Food Science and Quality Control (Self Financing) B.Com [Co-operation (SF)], BCA (SF), BA Mass Communication and Journalism and Five Post Graduate courses in Chemistry and Physics, Mathematics (SF), M.Com (SF), and M.Sc. Food Science and Technology (SF). An Integrated M.A. Programme in Languages English is also conducted here. The parents of students and the local population have been extending unconditional support for the onward progress of the College.

The College aims at the overall development of the students which would enable them to become ideal citizens of our country. The management, the faculty, and all the members of the non - teaching staff spare no pains to give all possible help for the spiritual, intellectual, moral, and academic excellence of the students put under the care of St. George, the Heavenly Patron.</p>
